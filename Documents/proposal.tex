\noindent \section{Introduction}

\noindent Currently, 4.66 billion people worldwide are connected to the internet. The internet makes it possible to find information quickly, communicate with people worldwide, listen to music, watch a video, and much more. People surf the internet to gather the information they need using various search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and many more. People tend to look for information through the web because it is way more accessible, and data can find almost everything.

\noindent Over 2 billion blog posts are published every year. According to a recent survey, blog posts continue to be the most famous content format among content marketers. Each blogger brings their perspective, experience, and style to the blog post they write. Many bloggers feel strongly about an issue or topic. They are motivated to write about it to bring attention to a nee. Which might be a social issue or cause, a problem that needs to be fixed, a belief or a value that strongly or desires to help people.

\noindent One of the most common web searches is "how-to". The information we find on the web on "how-to" means someone who already faces the same problem as us. They take the initial step to publishing the solution on the web so that it helps others.

\noindent The blog gives us the freedom of speech where anyone can share their thought without fear. It gives other people motivation to do certain things or helps them to find a solution they have been looking for.

\noindent 

\noindent \section{Objective}

\noindent Our goal is to develop an open-source blog platform for free blog content publication. Publishing a blog is not easy because of technical difficulties in the blog website.

\noindent The majority of blog users are of different ages, particularly young individuals who wish to share their personal experiences. Most people don't know how things operate, which makes publishing material a far more critical problem. We will build an easy-to-use content management system (CMS) to allow the content writer to organize the articles, publish and maintain the blog as they like. We will design the web interface which meets the WCAG 2.1 AA standard.

\noindent At the end of the project, we will achieve a platform that is easy to use, publish and maintain the blog.

\noindent 

\noindent \section{Target Audience}

\noindent Our primary target audience is young people who want to share their views and experiences with others. It will encourage people to contribute ideas, dreams, experiences. Users may post any topics, including sports, technology, entertainment, money, and many other themes on the internet.
